* Click **[HERE](https://laffitte-discord-clone.onrender.com/)** for the Live Demo

This is a clone of the popular messaging app Discord built using React/Rails. Full user auth is implemented, meaning users can sign up, sign in, and sign out. Once signed in, Users can invite one another to be friends, as well as remove friends once they're added. Users can create servers, in which they can create messaging channels. Server and channel names can be updated, and servers and channels can be deleted. Users can invite their friends into created servers and send instant-messages with WebSocket functionality.

To use the application, follow the link above to the Live Demo, and either create an account or use one of the provided demo users to access to app's functionality. Once signed in simply access a pre-existing server or create one, and try sending a message in a channel. Also try logging in with another account in a new incognito tab and sending yourself a message.
